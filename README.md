This page explains how the dice are reviewed and what category means what.

## Review Process

The set under review will be used in a gaming setup to test different conditions and I will take them out for foto shoots. Only after they went through these steps will I rate the different categories and assign a final score.

## Weighted Average

The score is a weighted average as I believe some categories are more important than others.

Weights:

- Readability: 3
- Playability: 2
- Quality: 1
- Value: 1
- Styling: 0.75
- Coolness: 0.5

## Categories

### Readability

Readability is such an important factor for actually using the dice in a game that I decided to make this its own category next to Playabillity.
This score determines how well can numbers on the dice be read under differnt lighting conditions and environments.

### Playability

Playabillity considers how well the dice can be used in an actual game or if they are meant as a collectors item. This category tries to answer if the dice are well balanced or made with high precision.

### Quality

Quality describes how well the dice are manufactured and trys to answer questions like:

Is paint within their molds?
Are all edges either well rounded or sharp egdged as advertised?
Are there any scratches out of the box or bubbles within a pull of raisin dice?
How durable are they?

### Value

Value determines if the set is worth the price you are paying. More expensive does not mean more valuable. I am trying to establish a score that gives you a reference to the price and how much the dice might degrade over time.

### Styling

Styling aims to incorporate the level of detail or the love that went into designing the dice. Is this set a very creative piece of art or are they not much to look at.

### Coolness

A somewhat subjective measure on how much fun I have using the dice for playing, collecting or fotographing.
