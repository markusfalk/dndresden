      <h1>DnDresden Dice Review Scoring System</h1>
      <p>
        This page explains how the dice are reviewed and what each score
        category and class means.
      </p>

      <h2>Review Process</h2>
      <p>
        The set under review will be used in a gaming setup to test different
        conditions and I will take them out for foto shoots. Only after they
        went through these steps will I rate the different categories and assign
        a final score.
      </p>

      <h2>How the score is calculated</h2>
      <p>
        The score is a weighted average as I believe some categories are more
        important than others.
      </p>

        src="assets/img/dice-review-scoring-system.jpg"
        alt="dice review scoring system"
      />
      <p>These are the weights I am using:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Readability: 3</li>
        <li>Playability: 2</li>
        <li>Quality: 1</li>
        <li>Value: 1</li>
        <li>Styling: 0.75</li>
        <li>Appeal: 0.5</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Categories</h2>

      <h3>Readability</h3>
      <p>
        Readability is such an important factor for actually using the dice in a
        game that I decided to make this its own category next to playability.
      </p>
      <p>
        This score determines how well can numbers or other words on the dice be
        read under different lighting conditions and environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Playability</h3>
      <p>
        Playabillity considers how well the dice can be used in an actual game
        or if they are meant as a collectors item. This category tries to answer
        if the dice are well balanced or made with high precision. Also some
        materials are quite sensitve and are not meant for heavy duty rolling
        which would decrease the score for this category.
      </p>

      <h3>Quality</h3>
      <p>
        Quality describes how well the dice are manufactured and trys to answer
        questions like:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Is paint within their molds?</li>
        <li>
          Are all edges either well rounded or sharp egdged as advertised?
        </li>
        <li>
          Are there any scratches out of the box or bubbles within a pull of
          resin dice?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Value</h3>
      <p>
        Value determines if the set is worth the price you are paying. More
        expensive does not mean more valuable. I am trying to establish a
        category that gives you a reference to the price and how much the dice
        might degrade over time.
      </p>

      <h3>Styling</h3>
      <p>
        Styling aims to incorporate the level of detail or the love that went
        into designing the dice. Is this set a very creative piece of art or are
        they not much to look at.
      </p>

      <h3>Appeal</h3>
      <p>
        A somewhat subjective measure on how much fun I have using the dice for
        playing, collecting or fotographing. Or simply a measure of how cool I
        think they are.
      </p>

      <h2>Dice Classes</h2>
      <p>
        Also, there are classes for the dice. The class itself does not
        influence the score. Rather it is an indicator for rareness or price.
